Hi! My name is [Jorge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSN1YaFNkrU), I am on the (hopefully) last year of my PhD in Statistics at Purdue University. I work with [Prof. Anindya Bhadra](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~bhadra/). My research mainly consists of computational methods that employ heavy tails for Bayesian statistical inference. I have also worked on causal inference and applied settings. 

I was born and raised in Costa Rica where I completed my undergraduate degrees in Universidad de Costa Rica. I studied pure math (2019) and actuarial sciences (2017). My experience includes working as a financial risk analyst in the financial sector in Costa Rica. In the Fall of 2018 I decided to pursue a higher degree and apply to graduate schools. Now, in Fall of 2023 I am on the job market looking for an academic position hoping to start in Fall 2024.

Aside from statistics, I love dancing and enjoy baking. When the weather permits, I also like taking nature-walks and riding my bike.
