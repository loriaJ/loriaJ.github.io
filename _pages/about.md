Hi! My name is [Jorge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSN1YaFNkrU), I am postdoctoral researcher working in Aalto University with [Prof. Samuel Kaski](https://kaski-lab.com/). I finished my PhD in Statistics from Purdue University, where I worked with [Prof. Anindya Bhadra](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~bhadra/). My research mainly consists of computational methods that employ heavy tails for Bayesian statistical inference. I have also worked on causal inference and applied settings. 

I was born and raised in Costa Rica where I completed my undergraduate degrees in Universidad de Costa Rica. I studied pure math (2019) and actuarial sciences (2017). My experience includes working as a financial risk analyst in the financial sector in Costa Rica.

Aside from statistics, I love dancing and enjoy baking. When the weather permits, I also like taking nature-walks and riding my bike.
