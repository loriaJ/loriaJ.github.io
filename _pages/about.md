I was born and raised in Costa Rica, recently I have been working on finishing my PhD at Purdue University. I work in the Department of Statistics, usually teaching, sometimes I get a research assistantship. My recent research considers methods to use heavy tails in statistical inference, I have also worked on causal inference and other applied settings. 

My undergraduate education was in Costa Rica, where I studied pure math and actuarial sciences. After working for a while in the financial sector and teaching in Universidad de Costa Rica, I decided that I wanted to pursue a higher degree. As mentioned above, I am working towards finishing my PhD. Will be looking for a job in Fall 2023, to start (hopefully) in mid-2024.
